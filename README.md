# Fluid-Sim
A fluid simulation based off Mike Ash's blog fluid simulation for dummies 

## READ-ME
This repo contains code of my first attempt at a fluid simulation.
NOTE: The program was written using processing.py which was a terrible decision for this project as it runs extremely slowly. I may at a later date convert it to use the the java version of processing.
